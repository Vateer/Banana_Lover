      Fix for bug#50227: Pre-auth buffer-overflow in mySQL through yaSSL
      
      Problem: copying issuer's (or subject's) name tags into an internal
      buffer from incoming stream we didn't check the buffer overflow. 
      That may lead to memory overrun, crash etc.
      
      Fix: ensure we don't overrun the buffer.

  32bit builds with the --enable-assembler flag (enabled by default)
  fail with an error message: undefined reference to `strmov_overlapp'.
  
  Since the fix for bug 48866 we use a home-grown strmov function
  instead of the ctpcpy function, but the source file for this
  function was missed in the Makefile.am.
  
  The strings/Makefile.am file has been modified to include strmov.c

  Bug #49137  	Replication failure on SBR/MBR + multi-table DROP TEMPORARY TABLE
        
  In statement-based or mixed-mode replication, use DROP TEMPORARY TABLE
  to drop multiple tables causes different errors on master and slave, 
  when one or more of these tables do not exist. Because when executed
  on slave, it would automatically add IF EXISTS to the query to ignore
  all ER_BAD_TABLE_ERROR errors.
  
  To fix the problem, do not add IF EXISTS when executing DROP TEMPORARY
  TABLE on the slave, and clear the ER_BAD_TABLE_ERROR error after
  execution if the query does not expect any errors.

  The problem is that Item_func_set_user_var does not set

message:
  Bug#48983: Bad strmake calls (length one too long)
  
  The problem is a somewhat common misusage of the strmake function.
  The strmake(dst, src, len) function writes at most /len/ bytes to
  the string pointed to by src, not including the trailing null byte.
  Hence, if /len/ is the exact length of the destination buffer, a
  one byte buffer overflow can occur if the length of the source
  string is equal to or greater than /len/.

  Fix for Bug#37408 - Compressed MyISAM files should not require/use mmap()
                    
  When compressed myisam files are opened, they are always memory mapped
  sometimes causing memory swapping problems.
  
  When we mmap the myisam compressed tables of size greater than the memory 
  available, the kswapd0 process utilization is very high consuming 30-40% of 
  the cpu. This happens only with linux kernels older than 2.6.9
  
  With newer linux kernels, we don't have this problem of high cpu consumption
  and this option may not be required.
   
  The option 'myisam_mmap_size' is added to limit the amount of memory used for
  memory mapping of myisam files. This option is not dynamic.
  
  The default value on 32 bit system is 4294967295 bytes and on 64 bit system it
  is 18446744073709547520 bytes.
  
  Note: Testcase only tests the option variable. The actual bug has be to 
  tested manually.

      5.0 buffer overflow for ER_UPDATE_INFO, or truncated info message in 5.1
            
      5.0.86 has a buffer overflow/crash, and 5.1.40 has a truncated message.
            
      errmsg.txt contains this:
            
      ER_UPDATE_INFO
      rum "Linii identificate (matched): %ld  Schimbate: %ld  Atentionari

      When that is sprintf'd into a buffer of STRING_BUFFER_USUAL_SIZE size,
      a buffer overflow can happen.
            
      The solution to this is to use MYSQL_ERRMSG_SIZE for the buffer size, 
      instead of STRING_BUFFER_USUAL_SIZE. This will allow longer strings. 
      To avoid potential crashes, we will also use my_snprintf instead of
      sprintf.

          Bug#48508: Crash on prepared statement re-execution.
          
          Actually there is two different bugs.
          The first one caused crash on queries with WHERE condition over views
          containing WHERE condition. A wrong check for prepared statement phase led
          to items for view fields being allocated in the execution memory and freed
          at the end of execution. Thus the optimized WHERE condition refers to
          unallocated memory on the second execution and server crashed.
          The second one caused by the Item_cond::compile function not saving changes
          it made to the item tree. Thus on the next execution changes weren't
          reverted and server crashed on dereferencing of unallocated space.
          
          The new helper function called is_stmt_prepare_or_first_stmt_execute
          is added to the Query_arena class.
          The find_field_in_view function now uses
          is_stmt_prepare_or_first_stmt_execute() to check whether
          newly created view items should be freed at the end of the query execution.
          The Item_cond::compile function now saves changes it makes to item tree.

      Bug #38883 (reopened): thd_security_context is not thread safe, crashes?
      
      The bug 38816 changed the lock that protects THD::query from
      LOCK_thread_count to LOCK_thd_data, but didn't update the associated
      InnoDB functions.
      
      1. The innobase_mysql_prepare_print_arbitrary_thd and the
      innobase_mysql_end_print_arbitrary_thd InnoDB functions have been
      removed, since now we have a per-thread mutex: now we don't need to wrap
      several inter-thread access tries to THD::query with a single global
      LOCK_thread_count lock, so we can simplify the code.
      
      2. The innobase_mysql_print_thd function has been modified to lock
      LOCK_thd_data in direct way.

          Bug #48472: Loose index scan inappropriately chosen for some 
                      WHERE conditions 
           
          check_group_min_max() checks if the loose index scan 
          optimization is applicable for a given WHERE condition, that is 
          if the MIN/MAX attribute participates only in range predicates 
          comparing the corresponding field with constants. 
           
          The problem was that it considered the whole predicate suitable 
          for the loose index scan optimization as soon as it encountered 
          a constant as a predicate argument. This is obviously wrong for 
          cases when a constant is the first argument of a predicate 
          which does not satisfy the above condition. 
           
          Fixed check_group_min_max() so that all arguments of the input 
          predicate are considered to decide if it passes the test, even 
          though a constant has already been encountered.

                      only const tables
          
          The problem was caused by two shortcuts in the optimizer that
          are inapplicable in the ROLLUP case.
          
          Normally in a case when only const tables are involved in a
          query, DISTINCT clause can be safely optimized away since there
          may be only one row produced by the join. Similarly, we don't
          need to create a temporary table to resolve DISTINCT/GROUP
          BY/ORDER BY. Both of these are inapplicable when the WITH
          ROLLUP modifier is present.
          
          Fixed by disabling the said optimizations for the WITH ROLLUP
          case.

          Add the missing module import.  Also, while here, fix a few glaring problems
          with the script, and ensure that it behaves properly.  It seems this script
          may have never been working correctly (e.g., reading password didn't chomp()
          the result, so password was set with \n at the end; comparing the re-typed
          password to original was done with inverted test).
          
          Add END { cleanup(); } block to ensure the script removes temporary working
          files.
          
          Add SIG{INT} / SIG{QUIT} handler.
          
          Do a bit of reorganization to make the code easier to understand.
          
          Limit failed connection attempts to 3.
          
          Use ./bin/mysql if it exists, and then fall back on mysql in PATH (before it
          assumed 'mysql' in the path).  Print a nicer error if 'mysql' can't be called.
          
          This has been tested on Windows (ActivePerl from cmd.exe, no cygwin needed)
          and Linux.
